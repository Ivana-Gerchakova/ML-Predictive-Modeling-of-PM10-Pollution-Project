# Project Title :
Machine Learning-Predictive-Modeling-of-PM10-Pollution-Project.

## Project Overview :
In response to the pervasive issue of poor air quality in Skopje, this project focuses on predicting PM10 particle levels in the Centar location. 
Utilizing the "Centar_cleaned" dataset, which includes various environmental metrics, our goal is to build a machine learning model capable of forecasting PM10 pollution.
